# My personal knowledge base

## Online digital garden, collection of my Obsidian notes

As with everything else related to webdev there are many different technologies available. Easy and simple way to do it is by utilizing static site generators. Taking notes and being able to publish it online is much different than writing a blog. Note systems and online digital gardens are more like a personal knowledge base shared with the world. Content is very focused, short and concise. There is no expectation of interesting read but presenting an idea or concept in easy to understand, easy to memorize format is a top priority.

What good note taking systems have is a well defined metadata like tags, references, information about source material... In other words digital gardens have well optimized structure that enables to find older notes but also connect different concepts. Digital gardens are much more like wiki style pages and almost nothing like blogs or articles you usually find online.

With all that said it is almost crucial that process of deployment, publish and styling is simple enough so all your focus can point to the actual note taking and refinement.

## Obsidian plugin: "Digital Garden"

If you open Obsidian settings and browse through community plugins, look for [Digital Garden](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) plugin. I recommend you to copy your private Obsidian vault into another directory and keep the separate vault that you would like to publish. All you need is a [Github](https://www.github.com) account and free [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account where the plugin will publish your notes. Just follow setup instructions [dg-docs.ole.dev/documentation](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) and you are ready in less than 15 minutes.

### Additional reading

The plugin uses the eleventy.js, static site generator. After you deploy everything by following the plugin documentation i would definitely recommend learning more about **eleventy.js**.
