# Personal web

## Pages

### Blog / Articles / Stories

   - **Functionality**: This will be a blog section where you can publish articles stored in MongoDB. You will need CRUD functionality to create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
   - **Implementation**:
	 - **Backend**: Use Node.js with Express to create an API to fetch articles from MongoDB. Mongoose can be used for schema management.
	 - **Frontend**: Use React with a rich text editor (like Quill.js) for writing posts. You can fetch articles via an API and display them using React components.
	 - **Pagination & Search**: Add pagination for easy navigation through posts and a search bar for article filtering.

   **Example Tech Stack**: React.js, MongoDB, Express.js (for API), Mongoose, TailwindCSS

### Projects


   - **Functionality**: Display all your web development projects. Each project should have its own page with details like tech stack, description, and a link to GitHub or live demo.
   - **Implementation**:
	 - Use cards or grid layout in React to list your projects. Each project card can link to a detailed page.
	 - Store project data either in MongoDB or statically in JSON files for simplicity.
	 - For styling, TailwindCSS’s grid and flexbox utilities will help create responsive layouts.

   **Example Tech Stack**: React.js, MongoDB (or JSON for simpler approach), TailwindCSS

### Digital garden


   - **Functionality**: The digital garden will function like a personal knowledge base where you can link notes together (think of it like a mini-wiki). You’ll want a system to create, edit, and interlink notes. Some of important features are backlinks, wikilinks, popover previews, callouts, syntax highlighting, table of contents, tag listings...
   - **Implementation**:
	 - **Backend**: MongoDB can store your notes. Each note can have fields for content, tags, and links to other notes.
	 - **Frontend**: Use React components to render notes and display wiki-style interlinks. For editing, you can use a markdown editor (like `react-markdown` or `remark`) and have the links generated automatically.
	 - Consider adding a graph visualization to show how notes are linked, using a library like D3.js or `react-force-graph`.

   **Example Tech Stack**: React.js, MongoDB, Express.js (for API), D3.js (or similar for visualizing links), TailwindCSS

### Newsletter

   - **Functionality**: This page allows users to subscribe to your newsletter. You could connect this to an email marketing tool like Mailchimp, or create your own simple newsletter system.
   - **Implementation**:
	 - **Frontend**: A simple React form that allows users to enter their email.
	 - **Backend**: Create a small API with Express to handle submissions and store them in MongoDB.
	 - You can integrate an email sending service like SendGrid or Nodemailer to handle sending emails.

   **Example Tech Stack**: React.js, MongoDB, Express.js (for API), Nodemailer/SendGrid, TailwindCSS

### General Features

- **Authentication**: If you want to have features like admin access to manage posts and projects, you can add a login page with JWT-based authentication.
  - **Backend**: Use Passport.js or a similar authentication middleware in Node.js.
  - **Frontend**: Implement login and protected routes in React.
- **Deployment**: Consider hosting on a platform like Vercel or Netlify (for frontend) and Heroku or DigitalOcean (for backend).

### Possible Alternatives

- **Next.js**: If you want server-side rendering (SSR) for better SEO (important for your articles), Next.js is an excellent alternative to React, and it works well with MongoDB.
- **Prisma**: Instead of Mongoose, you can use Prisma for working with your database in a more type-safe way.
- **TinaCMS or Contentful**: If you prefer a more CMS-style blog, TinaCMS or Contentful offer headless CMS options integrated with React.
