# Routes setup

Let's break down how these two lines work together:

```javascript
// in employeeRoutes.js
router.get("/", getAllEmployees);

// in app.js
app.use("/api/employees", employeeRoutes);
```

## The Flow of an API Request

1. **Base URL Registration (app.js)**
   - `app.use("/api/employees", employeeRoutes)` registers the employeeRoutes module as middleware
   - It sets "/api/employees" as the base path for all routes defined in employeeRoutes.js
   - Any request that starts with "/api/employees" will be forwarded to the employeeRoutes handler

2. **Route Handler (employeeRoutes.js)**
   - `router.get("/", getAllEmployees)` defines a GET endpoint
   - The "/" path here is relative to the base path defined in app.js
   - When combined with the base path, this creates the full route: "/api/employees/"

## Examples

When a GET request is made to `http://localhost:5000/api/employees/`:

1. Express first matches the base path "/api/employees" in app.js
2. The request is forwarded to employeeRoutes
3. Inside employeeRoutes.js, the "/" route matches
4. The getAllEmployees controller function is executed

When a POST request is made to `http://localhost:5000/api/employees/`

1. Express first matches the base path "/api/employees" in app.js
2. The request is forwarded to employeeRoutes
3. Inside employeeRoutes.js, the "/" route matches
4. The createEmployee controller function is executed

This modular approach allows for:
- Clean separation of routes into different files
- Logical grouping of related endpoints
- Easy maintenance and scaling of the API
- Consistent URL structure with common prefixes
