# Zoran Topic

 Since very early age i was interested in programming but life is upredictable, we often step on a very different path. Charmed by shiny lights, fine music and fine drinks i decided that bartending is a career for me. Wrong! True passion was growing inside me, from small little spark my inside was boiling until it bursted in flames. Point of no return.

 ## Skills and interests

Young, naive and overconfident. Now, 36 years of age, frustrated but highly motivated. I thought success will come by default but was wrong. I always felt confident with skills and value i offer to my employee. bartender since 2005 till now. and i was sure i am a good one. but after my 30 birthday i started to question. somehow i realized i have other skills and interests that none of my colleagues have. In more than a decade of my bartending None of my work buddies. few more years have passed and i am now sure i am different. i just don’t fit into the stereotype.

Started to wonder. who am i actually? Searching for a natural talent. Some was born as warriors, some as musicians and others as clowns. Who am i? Answer was in front of me every single day. What you do in your free time? That is a perfect career for you, if you can make it. Ever since high school technology was around me. While most of my friends just play the games. I always tried to find how mechanics work? How damage is calculated? How to get highest value with a minimal effort. And just like that my head bulb was lit. I love code, i love exploiting the system rules to get optimal results. never really a math guy but mechanics and background operations.

With my first lines of code in i got access to simplified interface. Everything can be done with a few mouse clicks. I had the urge to learn how all those components actually work. Launch the terminal and learn git, learn bash and linux scripting… like puzzles connecting the dots and forming a picture. Backend web development is my perfect fit. Then came machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data, all those really interesting stuff years ahead of me. Currently to high above my level. With 36 i think i am now more than ready to take that bite.

I am very passionate about it. Often short on time, having a full time job as a bartender, those moments in front of the screen with all tools loaded makes me really excited. Python is my first love and programming language where i am most comfortable. I enjoy doing coding challenges, practicing and learning every single day. I hope to find a job this year and finally prove that it's never late to pursue your dreams. Alongside python, i am learning javascript, html and css as i see them as a fundamental web technologies. Web apps are probably the easiest entry through the rabbit hole, my cheapest ticket for the high class. Start with web than find another road, small secret passage to AI and machine learning. I am a big fan of command line, always trying to look behind the screen and cool graphics, learn how mechanics in the background operates, how and who pulls the strings.

Just a casual simple guy, not much different from the rest of the herd you can see on the streets. When you think about it, it's shallow, only a fragment of who we are. If you dig a bit deeper you will see how special every single person is. Living through unique experiences that will shape our desires and our passion. Very early in life we start to diverge in unimaginable number of different personalities.

Who i am i, i am still not sure. I like to stay occupied, i enjoy being productive. Sometimes finding fun where others would get bored to death. That's the reason i write. I like writing
