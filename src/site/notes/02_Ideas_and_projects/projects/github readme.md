# üëã Why am i here?

Just a casual, simple person, nothing extraordinary at a first glance. But beneath the surface lies a unique and peculiar one. With his own experiences, desires, passions... Man can only hope there will be more good than bad ones.

I‚Äôm driven by curiosity, how those small and shinny little gadgets around us work. How they influence our desires and needs? That small piece of software you use daily, how does it run? Asking all those questions led me here so i can share the answers with anyone around me.
