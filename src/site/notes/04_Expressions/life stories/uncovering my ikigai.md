# Uncovering my ikigai

Life often has a way of surprising us, and my journey from behind the bar counter to becoming a web developer is a testament to that. I’m a simple guy, a 38-year-old on a quest to discover my Ikigai – that elusive balance of passion, profession, vocation, and the needs of the world. This is the story of how I found the courage to transition into the world of web development.

## Life behind the bar

For 15 years, I poured drinks, mixed cocktails, and witnessed countless stories unfold in the dimly lit ambiance of the bar I called home. While it had its charms, I couldn’t ignore the nagging feeling that something was missing. I yearned for a deeper sense of fulfillment, a reason to wake up in the morning that extended beyond the nightlife.

## Hint of passion

My fascination with mechanics and the inner workings of technology was a constant presence in my life. During the rare moments of downtime at the bar, I started to dive into the intricacies of technology, trying to understand how everything fits together. Each new insight felt like solving a puzzle, and it quickly turned into a passion. I couldn’t get enough of it.

## Self discovery

As I delved deeper into web development and technology, I realized that the path to mastering this craft was going to be challenging. I am a self-taught developer, which meant countless hours of learning, practicing, and overcoming obstacles. The late nights in front of my computer were tough, but they were also incredibly rewarding.

## World needs

While contemplating this career shift, I wondered if web development aligned with the needs of the world i live in. In today’s digital age, another industrial revolution, there’s a growing demand for talented and passionate guys willing and able to think out of the box and solve problems. Not to earn a paycheck but because they enjoy it so much. I can describe the feeling like solving the puzzle or winning the game you love playing. That is my Ikigai.

## Financial stability

Leaving the stability of my bartending job was a daunting prospect. The steady income had been my lifeline, but my growing passion for web development and understanding technology’s inner workings gave me the courage to embrace the unknown. I realized that I could be paid for something I loved and believed in.

## The journey ahead

My pursuit of Ikigai has brought me to this point, where I’m no longer just a bartender; I’m a budding web developer with a passion for understanding technology’s mechanics. My journey is ongoing, and the path ahead is still filled with uncertainty, but every line of code I write and every project I complete is a step closer to my true purpose.

As I continue this transition and exploration of my newfound passion, I want to share my knowledge and experiences with the world. This blog is the canvas where I’ll paint the picture of my journey – the challenges, the triumphs, and everything in between. My hope is that by sharing my story, I can inspire others to follow their passions and uncover their own Ikigai.

Until the next chapter of our adventure.
