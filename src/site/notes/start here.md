# Welcome my friend

Was looking for a way to turn my markdown notes into a static website, collection of knowledge and memories available to anyone. So here it is. Where to go from here you may ask?

You may start with a [[000_Workflow\|workflow rules]], i never enjoy restricting my creative output so these rules will transform and evolve with time. Set workflow should prevent myself from going all over the place. Keep ithe vault neat and organised. There is also an dditional benefit, with rules in place i can keep my focus on content instead of structure.

I am in a process of building my own web from the ground up but for now i use [Digital Garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) I guarantee you there is no easier way to publish your notes. If you decide to try it out be sure to create separate github token with restricted access to rest of your github account. Would be good to also make a copy of your vault since publishing like this need you to add some extra properties to your notes. Will probably write a short guide soon. My vault is available at the following URL: [zoran-topic.from.hr](https://www.zoran-topic.from.hr/)

Check out the [[_dataview_database/index\|dataview index]] and it's folder for a list of notes and properties i have.

## Now, let me tell you a story

A simple guy, nothing special about him, not much different from the other regulars you see in public. But.... that's just on surface, inside, every single one of us is very special. Living through unique experiences that shapes who we are. First love, first disappointment, first school fight.... Very early in life we start to diverge in unimaginable ways from each other but still, somehow, we are drawn to other people with similar interests.

I like to stay occupied, i enjoy being productive. Sometimes finding fun where others would get bored to death. That's the reason i write. I like writing.  Writing is more than just an escape or a way to pass the time. It's a reflection, a conversation with myself. Each word is like pulling back a layer, exposing thoughts I didn’t even know I had. It's strange, really, how putting pen to paper or fingers to keyboard can bring out emotions you didn’t realise were hiding beneath the surface.

I often think about the power of storytelling. How, with the right words, you can capture an entire moment, a fleeting feeling, or a lifetime of experiences. When I write, I'm not just telling a story; I'm weaving a piece of myself into it. Sometimes it's about people I've met, situations I've been in. Sometimes it's just pure imagination, creating worlds and characters that don’t exist, yet somehow feel more real than anything around me.

There’s something thrilling about it, like I’m both the creator and the observer. I write to understand, to make sense of the chaos that sometimes spins in my head. And if, by chance, my words resonate with someone else, if they read something I’ve written and feel even a fraction of what I felt while writing it than i did a good job.

But that’s the thing about sharing your thoughts no matter how personal they feel, you never know who might connect with them.
