# Effective literature notes

## Prepare before reading

- Set a purpose, think about important concepts you hope to learn.
- Create a template, use consistent format and sections for each chapter:
>**NOTE**
>There are many different literature types so following the same format style in self improvement books and technical literature is not what we aim for. It is important that any single note have defined structure and format. When starting a literature note, define the style and format early on and stick to it.

- Technical literature, proposed structure, feel free to edit and improve as you see fit.
  - Chapter title
  - Key concepts: define main ideas
  - Questions: What is worth exploring further?
  - Personal thoughts
  - Examples or code snippets
  - Summary
  - References or additional reading materials

## Active reading during the session

- Highlight key points but avoid stretching to wide.
- Write in your own words and summarise concepts instead of copy and paste.
- Note down questions that arise while reading.
- Capture examples.

## After reading session

- Organise your notes and transfer raw notes into structured format with clear section headings, tags and rest of metadata.
- Link related ideas and concepts. Use backlinks or references to connect ideas across different notes.
- Write brief summary in a few sentences.
